# skc-suggestion-engine

## Info

Go API that will extend functionality of [SKC API](https://github.com/ygo-skc/skc-api) with the following:

* Allow storage of deck list so users YT subscribers can easily copy a deck if they want to play it.
  * Functionality might be extended in the future to allow other people to submit their decks.
* Allow clients to send info about cards or products they are looking at with geo-location (using IP address) to build a trending view. This trending view will allow users to see what others are looking at (which helps w/ suggestions) and also see what is trending near them.
* Allow users to see what materials a specific extra deck monster can use in order to fulfill its summoning conditions.
  * Functionality will be extended to include reference suggestions, ie; if a card mentions another card (or archetype) the suggestion-engine will return all cards mentioned. This will group cards with a relation. This relation will help users browse similar cards. This will be great as it can leverage further work on cards that search for specific cards.

## Contact & Support

All info about the project can be found in the [SKC website](https://thesupremekingscastle.com/about)

If you have any suggestions or critiques you can open up a [Git Issue](https://github.com/ygo-skc/skc-suggestion-engine/issues)

This project was made to improve the SKC site and introduce myself to a new programming language. If you want to support, it's real simple, subscribe to [my channel on YT](https://www.youtube.com/c/SupremeKing25)!

## Usage

As of now, no one is permitted to use the API in any way (commercial or otherwise). The reason is, I don't have money to support multiple instances and environments. If multiple calls are being made, the performance will degrade and it's original purpose will be compromised.

If you need an API for teaching/education purposes, check out the [SKC API](https://github.com/ygo-skc/skc-api#others)

Otherwise, if you want to use this API, you can expedite the process by subscribing and watching [my content on YT](https://www.youtube.com/c/SupremeKing25).
